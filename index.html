            <b>Now some not-so-quick details… stick with me – it’s only the most relevant part of my life story!</b>  
            </p>
	    <p>
            I’m a surfer, artist, biologist, and now a statistician – I’ve gotten into a lot of different things in my life. I have a wide spectrum of interests and just want to gain expertise in them all! I enter new areas, but I never really leave any. I’ve been surfing since age 11, making design and studio art since receiving a five-year formal training in my teens, serving biological research and management missions since the years leading up to and 8 years following earning my bachelor’s degree, and upon receiving my master’s degree this May, statistics will be a new permanent piece of my identity. What inspired the move to statistics from biology? This is a long story, and I’ve already written a book here, so I’ll just say that the opportunities available to me in biology were rich and fine for my early years, but people’s needs change as they mature, and they simply would not satisfy my long-term needs. 
	    I needed a new skillset that would not only satisfy those needs, but also be a great fit for my interests and personality. By 2017, I had already identified this to be statistics, as I had an introduction to it in undergrad and loved it, but what really turned me on to it more than anything was seeing how our new director at the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Galveston Lab was revolutionizing our bycatch fishery observer program with machine learning – training computers to ID fish species and estimate lengths using camera images! The applications in statistics are fascinating, endless, and everywhere – even in fisheries. So I was sold. Spent 3 years working full-time for NOAA and schooling part-time to gather prerequisites needed to begin full-time graduate study in stats. And here I am, about to graduate!  
            </p>
	    <p>
            I’m driven by curiosity and the thrill of discovery in everything I do. I simply can’t resist tackling a good problem begging to be solved, as I relish in surmounting the intellectual challenges these present. Encountering difficulty and frustration only fuels my motivation, exponentially! I so enjoy refining my skills in the art that is coaxing truth out of chaos. All of these things together explain why I belong in statistics/data science. Just call me the data interrogator, or if you prefer a softer label – the data whisperer!  
            </p>
	    <p>
            Though all methodologies learned in school have been fascinating, I have most enjoyed the predictive analytics – time series modeling, Bayesian modeling, machine learning, etc. I’m most interested in jobs where I can spend most of my time doing this kind of work with room for creativity, and would happily do this in any industry.   
            </p>
	    <p>
            I have had a blast working on a group project [see portfolio below] and through this experience I gained highly valuable soft skills, and some hard skills, coursework alone simply cannot give me – skills I need to work in a team environment. Though working with a team is a rich experience, I am self-motivated, and can just as happily work independently. Another thing I find delightful is the thinking outside of the box that is often needed to effectively reach others in communicating ideas from an angle they can see. Lately, I’ve had some great hands-on experience doing this in consulting federal program research biologists on their statistical analysis needs [see portfolio section for more details], and I’m not lying when I say it’s fun! I don’t see why so many statisticians dislike consulting. I guess even though communicating technical ideas to an audience of diverse backgrounds is a different kind of challenge, it’s still a challenge, and I love them all! 
            </p>
	    <p>
            I’m a fast learner and have no issue with motivation to self-learn new skills. I put this portfolio site together in just a few days with absolutely no prior knowledge or experience with html, javascript, or css. I had a ton of fun doing it and now I have gained some basic insight into how websites are built. Our program unfortunately does not emphasize python and teaches primarily with R and SAS, but recognizing the importance of python skills, I have already learned the basics through self-learning resources, and am continuing on to learn packages for machine learning and visualization in python. I have identified other skills I plan to self-learn as well, and ASAP, as I do not want my skill pond to become stagnant – I want a steady stream of fresh abilities flowing in. 
            </p>
	    <p>
            My end goal is always to produce stunning quality of work through leveraging my intensely detail-driven mindset, and appetite to impress and progress the mission by going beyond the mark. My work is so much more than my work – it’s what I’m proud of, it’s what I own, it’s an important part of my identity.   
            </p>
	    <p>
            So that’s me - Thanks for listening!
