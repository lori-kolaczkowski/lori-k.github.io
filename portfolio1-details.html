              <h2>An Exciting Project with Potential for Real Nationwide Impact!</h2>
              <p>
                For over a decade, NOAA fishery managers have seen a need for a new model to serve as an improved alternative to the current one used in estimation of shrimp effort in the Gulf of Mexico. Shrimp effort is simply the total number of 24-hr days shrimp fisherman are actively fishing. Data used to calculate shrimp effort can only be collected for a subset of shrimp fishing trips, and so the subset becomes the sample used to build the model which will estimate shrimp effort for all trips in which effort is unknown. Why is shrimp effort important? Shrimp effort values in the Gulf of Mexico are used by NOAA Fishery Research Biologists to estimate bycatch mortality for populations of each fish species of economic importance in the Gulf of Mexico, e.g. red snapper, vermillion snapper, mutton snapper, red grouper, gag grouper, and flounder. Bycatch mortality describes how much of the population’s mortality is a result of being caught in shrimp fishermen’s nets. This bycatch mortality is one component biologists use to model the population dynamics of each of these species. These population dynamics models are then used to determine if a given fish population is being overfished. Fishery managers will respond to this status by, for example, closing the fishery to fishing until the population recovers. Many within NOAA Fisheries have expressed concerns over several identified weaknesses of the current model for estimating shrimp effort. They have urged leadership to direct efforts to investigate a new model which meets a list of criteria the current model does not meet. They just have not had the resources to accomplish this goal. 
Farron Wallace, director of the Southeast Fishery Science Center’s Galveston Laboratory has given me the opportunity to complete an analysis project which will focus on the development of the aforementioned alternative model. 
This improved model, if implemented, will improve the ability of fishery mangers to protect all commercially important Gulf of Mexico fisheries from overfishing. How cool is that?!
              </p>

                The data I need in order to perform the analysis is collected by NOAA Fisheries port agents and GPS devices aboard fishing vessels. This data is confidential and I cannot access it without formal processing procedures, which will take some time. In the meantime, I have done extensive literature review of peer-reviewed journal articles and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) technical memoranda. The director assigned a NOAA Research Fishery Biologist and a Data Manager to assist me with the data and technical NOAA information related to the analysis. I have met with them virtually for a handful of hour-long consulting meetings, in which NOAA’s needs were clarified, the type of data in NOAA’s databases was discussed, and my needs with respect to what data to request (which variables to consider and from what years) were shared.
              </p>
	      <p>
                My goal for the analysis is to develop a general linear model, which I believe to be most appropriate given the goal outlined by NOAA NMFS, the variable types, and the large amount of data. Considering that NOAA NMFS is concerned only with predictive performance of the model, this development will include exploratory data analysis, dealing with missing data, compiling a list of candidate models based on model diagnostics and covariates the literature points to as influential to shrimp effort, splitting the data into train and test sets, validating each model through repeated k-fold cross-validation, comparing predictive performance measures of each and selecting the best one and, finally, estimation of shrimp effort.  
              </p>
	      <p>
	      	Update: After a month of work initializing the project, a dramatic realignment within the NOAA NMFS Southeast center led to vast role changeovers. Consequently this project was delayed for months. In late July, Farron referred me to Dr. David Gloeckner, SEFSC Fishery Statistics Division Director, who now oversees the observer program and associated shrimp data. It was determined that the needed confidential data could not be shared with me via NDA, but after exchanging ideas with Dr. Gloeckner, we settled on a strategy which doesn't require me to see the confidential data in order to complete this modeling project. A NMFS Research Fishery Biologist has volunteered to supply me with a substitute data set, similar in size and format to the true data set, which I will use to write the inital bit of the analysis script. The script will be sent to the NMFS Biologist who will run the script on the true data and send me the output results. Using these results, I will determine the next steps and add to the script, and we will repeat the process until the analysis is complete.

	      <p>
	      	Stay tuned: Details on analysis and results will be shared here as the project moves forward!
