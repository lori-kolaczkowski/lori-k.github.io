              <h2>Project Details</h2>
              <p>
                This project is for a course in consulting, in which students are tasked with developing an analysis to answer a fictional client’s statistical question regarding their data. Students find and clean their data prior to analysis and the primary focus of the project report and presentation is effective communication in answering the client’s question.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data I have chosen is a portion of the dataset studied in a paper by Silvana Debernardi and colleagues, published in December of 2020, in PLOS Medicine. The study’s aim was to develop a urine sample diagnostic test which could accurately identify, in its early stages, a common form of pancreatic cancer: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The response variable will be diagnosis, a categorical variable of which 2 levels will be examined: 1 – PDAC, and 0 – non-cancerous pancreatic condition. The only predictor variables to be used are four individual urinary biomarkers, patient age, and patient sex. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The fictional client has taken interest in the Debernardi study, and has decided to build on that research by developing a random forest classifier to use patient biomarker measurements, sex, and age to accurately predict whether or not a patient with pancreatic problems may have pancreatic cancer. The client approaches me with a need for statistical consulting. There’s a problem – their classifier is measuring up to be 90% accurate, yet the classifier is classifying all cases known to be cancer as non-cancerous. The client wants to understand what is causing the issue and asks that I suggest an approach to alleviate the issue, and demonstrate this approach with their data.
              </p>
              <p>
                I conduct exploratory data analysis on the client’s data, and discover moderate class imbalance.  With this knowledge, I have the client describe to me the steps taken in their analysis as well as how they measured prediction accuracy. Based on this information, I diagnose the problem, and clarify to the client the ideas surrounding class imbalance and how, combined with use of an inappropriate measure of predictive performance, the analysis can lead to very misleading results. Some common approaches for addressing class imbalance are briefly outlined for the client, and illustrated with helpful graphics.  To formulate my suggested approach to address the issue, I test different combinations of sampling methods (undersampling, SMOTE, ROSE) and classifier algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines), and choose the one with the best appropriate measure of performance, considering the client’s greatest concern is wanting to avoid classifying a cancer case as non-cancerous. The process 		and results of my analysis are presented to the client in a succinct, clear, and engaging manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Report and presentation coming soon!
